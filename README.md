**Two-Factor Authentication must be disabled.** 

This program will not work unless the GitHub account used is recognized by the device and the user is logged in to the GitHub account in the Command-Line. When the user is logged on in both of those places, GitHub-Automation will work. If not logged in, the user can log into the services then restart the program.
